## Make Git Commits

When annotating Git commits, you can use various categories to provide context about the changes being made. Our categories include:

1. **Feature**: Use this category when introducing a new feature or functionality to the codebase.

2. **Fix**: Indicate fixes for bugs or issues in the code.

3. **Refactor**: Refactoring involves restructuring the code without changing its external behavior. This could include improving readability, performance, or maintainability.

4. **Documentation**: Changes related to documentation, such as updating README files, comments, or documentation within the code.

5. **Test**: Commits related to writing or modifying tests to ensure code correctness.

6. **Style**: Changes focused on code style, formatting, or naming conventions, without altering the code's functionality.

7. **Performance**: Commits aimed at improving the performance of the codebase, such as optimizing algorithms or reducing resource usage.

8. **Dependency**: Updates or changes to dependencies, libraries, or third-party components used in the project.

9. **Chore**: Miscellaneous tasks or changes that don't fit into the other categories, such as configuration updates, build process changes, or minor housekeeping.

10. **Security**: Commits addressing security vulnerabilities or implementing security measures.

11. **Merge**: Automatically generated commits resulting from merging branches or resolving conflicts.

These categories provide clarity and context to our commit history, making it easier for collaborators to understand the purpose and impact of each change.
