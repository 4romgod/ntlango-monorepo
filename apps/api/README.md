# Ntlango - TypeScript GraphQL Apollo Server with Express API, and AWS CDK Infrastructure

This repository contains the following tech stack:
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server
- Express
- AWS CDK for Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline.

It includes jest unit, integration, and canary tests located in the `test` folder.

## Getting Started

To get started with local development for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and define the required environment variables. Here's an example `.env` file:

   ```bash
   API_DOMAIN=<domain of the api>, e.g. http://localhost for development
   API_PORT=<port number>, you can choose any, e.g. 9000
   STAGE=<application environment>, i.e. Dev, Beta, Gamma, Prod ( since we are in dev, use "Dev" )
   MONGO_DB_URL=<url to your mongodb databse >
   JWT_SECRET=<secret string for JWT tokens >
   ```

4. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   during development, you can spin up a dev server like:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   when developing, you might want some data to seed your database, run:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Access the GraphQL Playground:**

   Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground by navigating to `http://localhost:9000/api/v1/graphql` in your web browser.

7. **Set up Git hooks (optional):**

   To ensure unit tests run before pushing code to the remote repository, set up the Git hooks by running the following npm script:

   ```bash
   npm run install-hooks

## Running Tests

To run tests for this project, you can use the following npm scripts:

- **Run unit tests:**

  ```bash
  npm test:unit
  ```

---
- **Run integration tests:**

   To run these, you will need to have all the necessary environment variables setup as explained on the [Get Started](#getting-started)

  ```bash
  npm run test:integration
  ```

---
- **Run canary tests:**

   To run these, you will need to have all the necessary environment variables setup as explained on the [Get Started](#getting-started)

  ```bash
  npm run test:canary
  ```

---
- **Run all tests**

   To run all tests, run the command
   ```
   npm run test
   ```

## Chores and Operations

These are things we do every now and then to keep this repository clean.

- **Run depchecks to check unused dependencies**

   ```bash
   npx depcheck
   ```

## Common Issues/Bugs and Their Fixes

### Issue: Incorrect Jest `moduleNameMapper` Configuration

### Symptom
When running Jest tests, you encounter errors like:
Could not locate module some modules like @/test/utils mapped as: rootDir/test/$1.

### Solution
* **Problem Description**: Jest's `moduleNameMapper` incorrectly maps paths, leading to module resolution errors.

* **Fix**: Correctly configure `moduleNameMapper` in your Jest configuration (usually `jest.config.js`) to handle path aliases.

   ```javascript
   moduleNameMapper: {
     '^@/(?!test)(.*)$': '<rootDir>/../../lib/$1',
     '^@/test/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/../../test/$1',
   }
> Explanation: Our Integration tests and Canaries are within their own ROOT directory. This means, for Jest's `moduleNameMapper`, we need to go out of the test's ROOT, and map our modules into the project's ROOT directory, hence `rootDir/../../lib/$1`


### Issue: TypeScript Path Alias Issue with JavaScript Build Output

### Symptom
After configuring TypeScript path aliases (`paths`) in `tsconfig.json`, the project fails to resolve paths correctly in the built JavaScript output. This leads to runtime errors due to module resolution failures.

### Solution
* **Problem Description**: TypeScript path aliases (`paths`) are specific configurations in `tsconfig.json` used for aliasing module imports to physical paths. However, these aliases are not recognized at runtime.

* **Workaround**: Use `tsconfig-paths/register` module to resolve TypeScript path aliases at runtime.

   - **Installation**: Install `tsconfig-paths/register`:
     ```bash
     npm install tsconfig-paths/register
     ```

   - **Usage**:

      Update your scripts to include `-r tsconfig-paths/register` flag to enable path alias resolution during runtime:

      Inside `package.json`
      ```json
      "scripts": {
        "start:ts": "ts-node lib/scripts/startServer.ts",
        "start:js": "node -r ts-node/register dist/lib/scripts/startServer.js"
      }
      ```

      Insight `tsconfig.json`

      ```json
      "ts-node": {
        "require": ["tsconfig-paths/register"]
      }
      ```

   - **Explanation**: 
     - `tsconfig-paths/register` registers TypeScript path aliases (`paths`) at runtime.
     - This allows Node.js to resolve modules correctly based on the configured paths in `tsconfig.json`.
     - For our `start:ts` script, we use `ts-node`, which is already configured inside our `tsconfig.json` file to use `tsconfig-paths/register` to register TypeScript aliases (`paths`) at runtime.

3. **Additional Notes**: 
   - Ensure that `tsconfig-paths/register` is included in your build and start scripts (`start` for development and `build` for production) to handle path aliases effectively.
   - Test the build output thoroughly to confirm that all modules are resolved correctly in the production environment.

### Unit Testing

Unit testing ensures that individual units or components of our code are working correctly. It's crucial for maintaining code quality and catching bugs early.

Here is a preview of our current test coverage (We removed tests that have 100% coverage).
